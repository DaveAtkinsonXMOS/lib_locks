# You can set flags specifically for your module by using the MODULE_XCC_FLAGS
# variable. So the following
#
#   MODULE_XCC_FLAGS = $(XCC_FLAGS) -O3
#
# specifies that everything in the modules should have the application
# build flags with -O3 appended (so the files will build at
# optimization level -O3).
#
# You can also set MODULE_XCC_C_FLAGS, MODULE_XCC_XC_FLAGS etc..
